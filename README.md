# jeeves v0.09-beta

jeeves is an IRC bot (under early development) written in Python.  The test application that is being developed has been tested and is currently running on Python 2.7.5.  The Jeeves bot will remain online and text/e-mail you when your friends connect to IRC.  A config.py, notify.list, and master.conf file are required for operation.  A sample service file, as well as sample required files are below:

### config.py
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

## CONFIG FILE

channels = [ '#testing', '#mynewbot' ]
server = 'irc.network.org'
port = 6667
botnick = 'jeeves-srv'
ident = 'jeeves'
real_name = 'Channel and Notify bot'
home_dir = '/home/user/jeeves/'
from_addy = 'notifier@example.com'
to_addy = '1234567890@txt.verizon.com'
```

### notify.list
```
# The following colon separated syntax can be used
# Note that no comments are allowed in the actual file
## nickname only
nick:
## nickname and ident
nick:ident
## nickname, ident, and any number of IP's or hostnames
nick:ident:example.com:192.168.:10.10.
## nickname, any ident, and any number of IP's or hostname
nick::example.com:192.168.:10.10.
```

### master.conf
